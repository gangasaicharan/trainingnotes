create command
===============
It is used to create a table in a database.

syntax:
			create table <table_name>(col1 datatype(size),col2 datatype(size), .....,
														colN datatype(size));

ex:
			create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));	

			create table dept(deptno number(3),dname varchar2(10),dloc varchar2(12));	

			create table emp(eid number(3),ename varchar2(10),esal number(10,2),
									deptno number(3),job varchar2(10),comm number(8));			

Describe command
=================
It is used to see the structure of a table.

syntax:
			desc  table_name;

ex:
			desc emp;
			desc dept;
			desc student;

Insert command
===============
It is used to insert a record/row in a table.

syntax:
			insert into <table_name> values(val1,val2,....,valN);

ex:
		insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');  //invalid 

		insert into student values(102,'ravi'); //invalid not enough values

null
-----
	null is a operator which represent undefined or unavailable.

		insert into student values(102,'ravi',null); //valid 

approach2
---------
		insert into student(sno,sname,sadd) values(103,'ramana','vizag');

		insert into student(sno,sname) values(104,'ramulu');

approach3
----------
	Using '&' symbol we can insert dynamic values.
	ex:
			insert into student values(&sno,'&sname','&sadd');			

commit command
============
It is used to make the changes permanent to database.

syntax:
				commit;

dept table
============
create table dept(deptno number(3),dname varchar2(10),dloc varchar2(12));	

insert into dept values(10,'ECE','HYD');
insert into dept values(20,'EEE','PUNE');
insert into dept values(30,'CSE','DELHI');
insert into dept values(40,'MEC','VIZAG');
commit;


emp table
==========
create table emp(eid number(3),ename varchar2(10),esal number(10,2),
									deptno number(3),job varchar2(10),comm number(8));	

insert into emp values(201,'Alan',9000,10,'Clerk',null);
insert into emp values(202,'Jose',19000,10,'Clerk',500);

insert into emp values(203,'Kelvin',29000,20,'HR',900);
insert into emp values(204,'Nelson',49000,20,'HR',500);

insert into emp values(205,'Lisa',23000,30,'Manager',800);
insert into emp values(206,'Brenda',36000,30,'Manager',600);

commit;

select command

Projection
-----------
	Selecting specific columns from the database table is called projection.
	ex:

			select sno,sname from student;
			select dname from dept;

In select command we can perform arithmetic operations also.
ex:
			select sno+100 from student;			
			select sno-100 from student;

Types of Data
==============
We have two types of data.

1)Unstructured Data 

2)Structured Data 

1)Unstructured Data 
---------------------
Data which is not in readable format is called unstructured data.

In general, meaningless data is called unstructured data.

ex:
			201    Lakemba    SYD    NSW   AUS

2)Structured Data
---------------
Data which is in readable format is called structured data.

In general, meaningfull data is called structured data.

ex:
			unit	  Locality   city  state  country 
        ----    -------    ----  ----- -------
			201    Lakemba     SYD    NSW   AUS

Oracle 
=======
Oracle is one of the database which is used to store structured data.

Oracle is a product of oracle corporation.

Oracle is classified into two types.

											Oracle
												|
			|---------------------------------------------------| 
		  SQL																		PL/SQL 
(Structured Query Language)								(Procedural /Structured Query Language)

We have following list of oracle versions like 10g , 11g , 12c and 13i.


Client/Server Architecture
===========================
In this architecture we will see ,how our data will store from frontend to backend.

Diagram: oracle1.1

FrontEnd
--------
The one which is visible to the enduser to perform some operations is called 
frontend.
ex:
		Java, Python, .net, Perl , D2k and etc.

Communication Channel
----------------------
It acts like a bridge between frontend and backend.
ex:
		JDBC - Java Database Connectivity
		ODBC - Open Database Connectivity 
		PDBC - Python Database Connectivity 

BackEnd
-------
The one which is not visible to the enduser but it performs operations based 
on the instructions given by frontend is called backend.

Management System 
==================
It is a software which is used to manage the database.

Using management system we can perform following activities very easily.

1) Adding the new data

2) Modifying the existing data

3) Deleting the unnecessary data

4) Selecting the required data

DBMS
=====
A database along with software which is used to manage the database is called 
database management system.

Lots of drawbacks of DBMS
-------------------------
> Single user 
> Does not support Normalization 
> It does allow any relationships(parent table and child table)
> waste of memory

RDBMS
======
If a database is created based on relational theories to manage the database is 
called relational database management system.
ex:
		Oracle, MySQL , SQL Server, Sybase, Teradata and etc.

SQL
=====
SQL stands for Structured Query Language which is pronounce as SEQUEL.

This language is used to interact with oracle database.

It is a case insensitive language.
ex:
		select * from student;
		SELECT * FROM STUDENT;

It is a command based language.

Every command must starts with verbs like select,update,delete,merge and etc.

Every command ends with semicolon(;).

It is developed by Mr.Codd in 1972 (By IBM).

Sub languages of SQL 
====================
We have five sub languages of SQL.

1) DDL (Data Definition Language)

2) DML (Data Manipulation Language)

3) DRL/DQL (Data Retrieve/Query Language)

4) TCL (Transaction Control Language)

5) DCL (Data Control Language)

1) DDL
--------
It is used to maintain the objects in database.

It is a collection of five commands.

ex:
		create,alter,drop,truncate and rename

2) DML
--------
This language is used to manipulate the present in database.

It is a collection of four commands.

ex:
			insert,update,delete and merge 	

3) DRL/DQL
----------
This language is used to retrieve the data from database.

It is a collection of one command.
ex:
		select 


4) TCL
--------
This language is used to maintain the transaction of database.

It is a collection of three commands.
ex:
		commit,rollback and savepoint.

5) DCL
--------
This language is used to control the access of the data to the user.

It is a collection of two commands.
ex:
		grant and revoke 

Oracle 
=======
Version			:	10g or 11g

Vendor			:	Oracle Corporation 

Creator			:	Mr. Codd 

Port No			:	1521

website			: www.oracle.com/in/database

username      : system (default)

password      : admin

Establish the connection with database software
================================================
To perform or execute any query in database we need to establish the connection 
with database software.

Once the work with database is completed. we need to close the connection with database.

1) 
SQL> connect 
Username : system 
Password : admin

SQL> disconnect 

2) 
SQL> conn 
username : system
password : admin 
SQL> disc 

3)
SQL> conn system/admin 
SQL> disc

Table
=======
Table is an object which is used to represent the data.

A table is used to store the data in the form of rows and columns.

ex:
			SNO			SNAME			SADD
			---------------------------
			101 			Alan			USA
			---------------------------
			102			Jose			UK
			---------------------------
			103			Nelson		UAE
			---------------------------

In above table we have 3 rows and 3 columns.
Oracle is a case insensitive but data which is present in a table is a case sensitive.

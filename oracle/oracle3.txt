Logical Operators
==================
Logical operators are used to declare more then one condition in a query.

We have three types of logical operators.

1) AND 

2) OR 

3) NOT 

1) AND
--------
It will return the records only if all conditions are true.

Here both conditions must be from same row only.

ex:
	select * from emp where eid=201 AND ename='Alan';

	select * from emp where eid=201 AND ename='Nelson';  // No rows selected 

	select * from emp where eid=209 AND ename='jojo'; // No rows selected 

2) OR 
------
It will return the records only if one condition is true.

Here both conditions can be from any row.

ex:
	select * from emp where eid=201 OR ename='Alan';    // 1 records 

	select * from emp where eid=201 OR ename='Nelson';  // 2 records 

	select * from emp where eid=209 OR ename='jojo';    // no rows selected 

3) NOT 
-------
It will return the records except the condition.

A '<>' symbol denoted as NOT operator.

ex:
---
	select * from student where NOT sno=101;

	select * from student where  sno<>101;

	select * from dept where NOT deptno=10;
	
	select * from student where sadd<>'hyd';


Interview Queries
-----------------

Q) Write a query to display employees information whose employee id is 201,202 and 203?

	select * from emp where eid=201 OR eid=202 OR eid=203;


Q) Write a query to display employees information whose salary is greater then 20000 and 
   less then 40000?

	select * from emp where esal>20000 AND esal<40000;


Q)Write a query to display employees information who are not working in 20 department?

	select * from emp where deptno<>20;

BETWEEN operator
================
It is used to return the records those who are in the range of values.

In between operator first we need to write lower limit then higher limit.

Between operator we can use only for numbers.

Between operator will take the support of AND operator.

ex:
	select * from emp where eid between 201 AND 206;	

	select * from emp where deptno between 10 AND 30;

	select * from emp where esal between 20000 AND 40000;


IN operator
============
IN operator is a replacement of OR operator.

IN operator will return the records those who are matching in the list of values.

ex:
	select * from emp where eid IN(201,202,203);

	select * from emp where ename IN('Alan','Nelson','Ana');

	select * from emp where deptno IN(10,20,30);

Pattern Matching Operators
==========================
Pattern matching operators are used to select the letters from database table.

Pattern matching operators will take the support of like keyword.

We have two types of pattern matching operators.

1) Percentage(%)

2) Underscore(_)

1) Percentage(%)
-----------------
Q)Write a query to display employees information whose name starts with 'A' letter?
 
	select * from emp where ename like 'A%';

Q)Writea query to display employees information whose name ends with 'n' letter?
	
	select * from emp where ename like '%n';

Q)Write a query to display employees information whose name having middle letter as 'l'?

	select * from emp where ename like '%l%';

2) Underscore(_)
-----------------
Q)Write a query to display employees information whose employee name having second letter 
  as 'l'?

	select * from emp where ename like '_l%';	

Q)Write a query to display employees information whose employee name having second 
  last letters as 'd'?  

	select  * from emp where ename like '%d_';

Q)Write a query to display employees information whose employee name having third 
  letter as 's' ?

   	select * from emp  where ename like '__s%';

Duplicate table or Copy of table
================================
Using create and select command we can create duplicate or copy of a table.

If something goes wrong then we can recover the situation by using duplicate table.

syntax:
	create table <table_name> as select stmt;

ex:
	create table employee as select * from emp;

	create table employee as select * from emp where deptno=10;

	create table employee as select eid,ename,esal from emp;

	create table employee as select * from emp where job<>'Manager';

	create table employee as select * from emp where eid IN(201,202,203);

	create table employee as select * from emp where esal between 10000 AND 30000;

	create table employee as select * frome emp where ename like 'A%';

cl scr
=======
IT is used to clear the output screen of SQL command prompt.
ex:
	cl scr

DDL commands
=============
1) create  (tables)
2) alter (columns)
3) drop  (tables)
4) truncate (rows/records)
5) rename (tables) 

2) alter command
-----------------
Using alter command we can perform following activities very easily.

i)Adding the new column

ii)Modifying the existing column 

iii)Renaming a column

iv)Dropping a exisitng column 

i)Adding the new column
----------------------
Using alter command we can add new column in a existing table.

syntax:
	alter table table_name ADD (col datatype(size));
ex:
	alter table student ADD (state varchar2(10));
	alter table student ADD (pincode number(8));

	update student set state='Telangana' where sno=101;


ii)Modifying the existing column 
---------------------------------
Using alter command we can modify the existing column.

We can increase or decrease the size of a column only when existing values are fit into 
new size.

syntax:
	alter table <table_name> MODIFY (col datatype(size));
ex:
	desc student;
	alter table student MODIFY (state varchar2(15));
	desc student;

We can change the datatype of a column only if that column is empty.
ex:
	alter table student MODIFY (pincode varchar2(8));

iii)Renaming a column
------------------------
Using alter command we can rename a column name.

syntax:
	alter table <table_name> rename column <old_name> to <new_name>;
ex:
	alter table student rename column sadd to city;

	alter table emp rename column esal to dailywages;

	alter table emp rename column job to designation;

iv) Dropping a existing columns 
---------------------------------
Using alter command we can drop existing columns.

syntax:
	alter table <table_name> drop (col1,col2,...,colN);

ex:
	alter table student drop (state,pincode);

3) drop command
---------------
A drop command is used to drop the tables from database.

syntax:
	drop table <table_name>;
ex:
	drop table emp;
	drop table dept;
	drop table student;

4) truncate
--------------
It is used to delete the records permanently from database table.

syntax:
	truncate table <table_name>;
ex:
	truncate table emp;
	truncate table dept;
	truncate table student;

Q)What is the difference between delete and truncate command?

delete						truncate
--------					----------
It is used to delete the records temperory.	It is used to delete the records permanently.

We can rollback the data.			We can't rollback the data.

Where clause can be used.			Where clause can't be use.

5) rename 
----------
It is used to rename the table name.
syntax:
	rename <old_name> to <new_name>;
ex:
	rename student to students;
	rename emp to employees;
	rename dept to departments;



Functions
==========
Functions are used to manipulate the data items and gives the result.

We have two types of functions.

1)Group Functions / Multiple row functions

2)Scalar Functions / Single row functions 

1)Group Functions
-----------------
Group functions are applicable for multiple rows.

We have following list of group functions.
ex:
	sum(), avg(), max() , min() , count(*) and count(exp).

Q) Write a query to display sum of salary of each employee?

   select sum(esal) from emp;

Q) Write a query to display average salary of each employee?

   select avg(esal) from emp;

Q) Write a query to display highest salary from employee table?
	
   select max(esal) from emp;

Q) Write a query to display lowest salary from employee table?

   select min(esal) from emp;

Q)What is the difference between count(*) and count(exp) ?

count(*)
-------
It will return number of records present in database table.

It will include null records also.

ex:
	select count(*) from student;
	select count(*) from emp;
	select count(*) from dept;

count(exp)
-----------
It will return number of values present in datable table column.

It won't include null values.

ex:
	select count(esal) from emp;//6

	select count(comm) from emp;//5


Userlist table
==============
create table userlist(uname varchar2(10),pwd varchar2(10));

insert into userlist values('raja','rani');

insert into userlist values('king','kingdom');

commit;

Q)Write a query to check username and password is valid or invalid?

	select count(*) from userlist where uname='raja' and pwd='rani'; // 1 

	select count(*) from userlist where uname='raja' and pwd='rani2'; // 0 


Dual table
===========
A dual table is a dummy table which consist one row and one column.

Dual table is used to perform arithmetic operations and to see the current system date.

ex:
	select 10+20 from dual;

	select 10*20-100 from dual;

	select sysdate from dual;

	select current_date from dual;


2)Scalar Functions

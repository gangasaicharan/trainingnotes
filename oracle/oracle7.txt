Pseudo columns
===============
Pseudo column means a column which is not real.

We have two pseudo columns.

1) ROWNUM

2) ROWID 

1) ROWNUM
----------
ROWNUM values always starts with 1 and increment by 1.

ROWNUM values are temperory.

ex:
	select eid,ename,esal from emp;
	select rownum,eid,ename,esal from emp;
	select rownum,sno,sname,sadd from student;

2) ROWID 
--------
ROWID is a memory location where our records will store in a database table.

ROWID is permanent.

ex:
	select rownum,eid,ename,esal from emp;
	select rowid,rownum,eid,ename,esal from emp;	

Q)Write a query to display first records from emp table?

	select * from emp where rownum<=3;


Q)Write a query to display 4th record from emp table?

	select * from emp where rownum<=4
	minus
	select * from emp where rownum<=3;


Q)Write  a query to display 6th record from emp table?

	select * from emp where rownum<=6
	minus
	select * from emp where rownum<=5;


TCL commands
=============
commit
rollback
savepoint 

commit
--------
It is used to make the changes permanent to database.
ex:
	drop table student;
	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));
	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');
	insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');
	commit;
	select * from student;// 2 records 

rollback
---------
It is used to undo the changes which are not permanent.
ex:
	drop table student;
	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');
	insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');

	commit;

	insert into student values(103,'Jacky','Florida');
	insert into student values(104,'James','Texas');

	select * from student; // 4 records

	rollback;

	select * from student; // 2 records 
	
savepoint 
----------
It is used to maintain the logical marking in a database.

Instead of complete rollback we can rollback upto save point.

syntax:
	savepoint <savepoint_name>;
ex:
	drop table student;
	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');
	insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');

	savepoint sp1;

	insert into student values(103,'Jacky','Florida');
	insert into student values(104,'James','Texas');

	savepoint sp2;

	insert into student values(105,'Nelson','USA');
	insert into student values(106,'Kelvin','UK');

	select * from student; // 6 records 

	rollback to sp2;

	select * from student; // 4 records 

	rollback to sp1;

	select * from student; // 2 records 


DCL commands
=============
grant 
revoke 

Schema
------
	Schema is a memory location which is used to run SQL commands.

		stmt1;
		stmt2;
		stmt3;
	</script>

	Here "type" attribute is optional.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
	<script type="text/javascript">
		document.write("Welcome to JavaScript");
	</script>	
</body>
</html>

ex:2
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
	<script>
		document.write("Welcome to JavaScript class")
	</script>	
</body>
</html>

ex:3
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
	<script>
		document.writeln("Welcome to JavaScript class");
		document.writeln("This is Ihub Talent");
	</script>	
</body>
</html>

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
	<script>
		document.writeln("Welcome to JavaScript class");
		<br>
		document.writeln("This is Ihub Talent");
	</script>	
</body>
</html>

Note: We can't mix markup language in scripting language.

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
	<script>
		document.writeln("Welcome to JavaScript class");
		document.writeln("<br>");
		document.writeln("This is Ihub Talent");
	</script>	
</body>
</html>

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
	<script>
		document.writeln("<h1 style='color:red'>Welcome to JavaScript class</h1>");
		document.writeln("<br>");
		document.writeln("<p style='color:blue'>This is Ihub Talent</p>");
	</script>	
</body>
</html>
Note:
-----
If a program contains HTML, CSS and JavaScript then it is called DHTML.

DHTML stands for Dynamic Hypertext Markup language.

JavaScript Engine
==================
JavaScript engine allows us to execute script code on browser window.

It converts user understandable scripting language to machine understandable scripting language.

By default , every browser contains javascript engine so we don't need to arrange it seperately.

We have following list of javascript engines.

ex:
	Browser 		JavaScript Engine
	--------------		------------------
	Chrome			V8 Engine 
	Mozilla 		Spider monkey
	Edge			Chakra 
	and etc.


Comments in Javascript
=======================
Comments are created for documentation purpose.

Comments are used to improve readability of our code.

In javascript , comments are divided into two types.

1) Single line comment 
----------------------
	It is used to comment a  single line.
	ex:
		// comment here 

2) Multiple line comment 
----------------------
	It is more convenient because we can comment single line and multiple lines.
	ex:
		/*
			-
			- comment here 
			-
		*/
Note:
----
	HTML	--	<!--   comment here -->

	CSS	--	/*    comment here   */

Output statement in javascript
===============================
Whenever we want to display any userdefined statements or data then we need to use output statement.

We have following output statements in javascript.

1) document.writeln()

2) console.log() 

1) document.writeln()
---------------------
It is used to display the output on browser window.
ex:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
	<script>
		document.writeln("Hello World");
	</script>	
</body>
</html>

2) console.log() 
---------------
It is used to display the output on browser console.

In order to see browser console we need to press F12 function key.

ex:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
	<script>
		console.log("Hello World");
	</script>	
</body>
</html>

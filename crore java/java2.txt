History of Java
================
In 1990, Sun Micro System took one project to develop a software called consumer electronic device which can be controlled by a remote like setup box.That time project was called Stealth project but later it is renamed to Green project.

James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton were to develop this project and they have met in a place called Aspan/Colarado to start the work with graphic system.
James Gosling decided to use C and C++ languages to develop the project.But the problem what they have faced is C and C++ languages are system dependent. Then James Gosling decided why don't we create our own programming language which is system independent. 

In 1991, They have developed one programming language called an OAK. OAK means strength , itself is a coffee seed name and it is a national tree for many contries like Germany, France, USA and etc.

Later in 1995, they have renamed OAK to Java.Java is a island of an indonesia where first coffee of seed was produced and during the development of project , they were consuming lot of coffee's.Hence the symbol of java is a cup of coffee with saucer.

In 2010, Oracle Corporation took/acquire Sun Micro System company.

Now java is a product of Oracle Corporation company.

Limitations with Spring Framework
=================================
In spring framework a user is responsible for following things.

> Adding the dependencies/jar files 

> Performing configuration (applicationContext.xml) 

> Arranging the physical server i.e Tomcat.

> Arranging the physical database i.e oracle.

To overcome this limitations we need to use spring boot framework.

Spring Boot
============
It is an open source java based application framework developed by Pivotal Team.

It provides RAD(Rapid Application Development) features for spring based applications.

It is an open source, production ready grade spring based applications with minimum configurations.

In short , spring boot is a combination of 
ex:
	spring framework + embedded database + embedded server.

It provides production ready grade featurs like metrics, health check, externalized configuration and etc.

It provides optionate starters to simply the Maven configuration.

It supports number of plugin's.

It does not support xml configurations instead we will use annotations.

It reduce the development time and gives more productivity.

It provides CLI tool for creating and testing spring boot applications.

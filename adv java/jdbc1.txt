JDBC
=====
As if now it is know as trademark.

But earlier it is known as Java Database Connectivity.

RAM is a temperory storage device or medium.

During the program execution our data will store in RAM.

Once the program execution is completed we will loss the data.

To overcome this limitation we are making our application writing the data into file or database software.

File and database software acts like a permanent storage device or medium.
	
Persistence 
===========
The process of storing and managing the data for a long period of time is called persistence.

Important terminologies
----------------------

1) Persistence store 
------------------
It is a place where we can store and manage the data for a long period of time is called persistence store.
ex:
	Files
	Database Software 

2) Persistence data 
-------------------
A data of a persistence store is called persistence data.
ex:
	Records 
	Tables

3) Persistence operations 
------------------------
Insert,Update,Delete,Create and etc are called persistence operations.
In realtime this operation is called CURD operation, CRUD operation or SCUD operation.
ex:
	C - create	S - select  
	U - update 	C - create
	R - read     	U - update 
	D - delete	D - delete


4) Persistence logic 
--------------------
A logic which is capable to perform persistence operations is called persistence logic.
ex:
	IOStream 
	JDBC Code 
	Hibernate Code 
	and etc.
	

5) Persistence technology
-----------------------
A technology which is used to develop persistence logics is called persistence technology.
ex:
	JDBC 
	Hibernate
	Ibatis
	and etc.

Q)What is JDBC?

JDBC is a persistence technology which is used to develop persistence logics having the capability to perform persistence operations on persistence data of a persistence store.

Note:
-----
				IOStream 
	JavaApp	------------------------------------- Files
		 Serialization / Deserialization 


				JDBC Code 
	JavaApp ------------------------------------- DB S/W 


Serialization
=============
The process of convert from object state to file state is called serialization.

In serialization object will not store in a file, object data will store in a file.

Diagram: jdbc1.1


Deserialization
================
The process of convert from file state to object state is called deserialization.

The process or taking the data from a file and representing an object is called deserialization.

diagram: jdbc1.2


Limitations with files as persistence store
============================================
> It will store limited amount of data.

> There is no security. 

> Fetching the data with multiple conditions is not possible.

> It does not show an application with relationships.

> It does not allow us to apply constraints i.e. NOT NULL , UNIQUE , 
  Primary key, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK.

> Updation and deletion of data can't be done directly.

> Merging and comparision of data can't be done easily.


Advantages with Database as persistence store
==============================================
> It will store unlimited amount of data.

> There is a security.

> It supports command query language.

> Fetching the data with multiple conditions is possible.

> It shows an application with relationships.

> It allows us to apply constraints.

> Updation and Deletion of data can be done directly.

> Merging and comparision of data can be done easily.

Every JDBC application is a two tier application where Java with JDBC code will acts like a frontend/tier1/layer1 and database software acts like a backend/tier2/layer2. 

Enduser is a non-technical person.He can't prepare and execute SQL query in database software.So he depends upon frontend developers having the capability to do that work for them.

JDBC Driver
==========
It acts like a bridge between java application and database software.

It is used to convert Java calls to database calls and vice versa.

Here calls means instructions.

Diagram: jdbc1.4

ODBC Driver
============
VBScript, D2K , Perl and etc uses ODBC driver to locate and interact with database software.

Diagram: jdbc1.5

ODBC driver is develop in c language by taking the support of pointers.But java does not support pointers.So we can't take odbc driver to interact with database software.

To overcome this limitation Sun Micro System introduced JDBC driver exclusively.

We will get JDBC software from following parties.

1) Sun Micro System (creator of JDBC driver)

2) Database Vendor 

3) Third party Vendor 


We will get ODBC software from following parties.

1) Xopen company(creator of ODBC driver)

2) Database Vendor 

3) Third party Vendor 


Q)What is JDBC ?

JDBC is a open technology given by Sun micro system having set of rules and guidelines to develop jdbc drivers for multiple database softwares.


Q)What is ODBC?

ODBC is a open technology given by Xopen company having set of rules and guidelines to develop ODBC drivers for multiple database softwares.

Q)Types of drivers in JDBC?

We have four drivers in JDBC.

1) Type1 JDBC driver  / JDBC-ODBC bridge drive 

2) Type2 JDBC driver / Native API  

3) Type3 JDBC driver  / Net Protocol 

4) Type4 JDBC driver / Native Protocol 


Oracle Database
=================
Version		:	10g or 11g 

Open source	:	Open source 

Vendor		:	Oracle Corporation 

username	:	system (default)

password	:	admin 

Default portno	:	1521

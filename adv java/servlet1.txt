Web Application
================
A web application is a collection of web resource programs having the capability to generate web pages.

We have two types of web pages.

1)Static web pages / Passive web page 
----------------------------------
A web page which shows the same content is called static web page.
ex:
	home page
	contact page
	services page
	facebook login page
	and etc.


2)Dynamic web pages / Active web page 
----------------------------------------
A web page which shows the different content based on the request or time is called dynamic web page.
ex:
	live cricket score page
	gmail inbox page 
	stock market share value page 
	and etc.

We have two types of web resource programs.

1)Static web resource program 
----------------------------
Static web resource program will generate static web pages.
ex:
	HTML program
	CSS program 
	Bootstrap program 
	Angularjs progra m
	and etc.

2)Dynamic web resource program 
---------------------------------
Dynamic web resoure program will generate dynamic web pages.
ex:
	servlet program
	jsp program
	and etc.	

Based on the position and execution these web resource programs are divided into two types.

1)Client side web resource program 
--------------------------------
A web resource program which executes at client side(browser window) is called client side web resource program.
ex:
	html program
	CSS program
	Bootstrap program
	angualrjs program 
	and etc.

2)Server side web resource program
----------------------------------
A web resource program which executes at server side is called server side web resource program.
ex:
	servlet program 
	jsp program 


Web Application and Web Resource program execution
===================================================
Diagram: servlet1.1

Java application will execute manually.

Web application and web resource program will execute when they have requested.So there is no chance of executing manually.

With respect to the diagram
----------------------------

1) Enduser will give the request to web source program.

2) Server will trap that request and it will pass that request to appropriate 
   web resource program.

3) Web resource program will execute the logic to process the request.

4) Web resource program will communicate with database software if necessary.

5) Web resource program will give output to web server.

6) Web server will give the output to browser as dynamic response.

Note:
-----
The process of keeping the web application in a server is called deployment and reverse is called undeployment.


Web Server 
===========
It is a piece of software which is used to automate whole process of web application and web resource program execution.
ex:
	Tomcat, Resin  and etc.

Responsibilities of web server
-------------------------------
> It takes continues request from client.

> It pass the request to appropriate web resource program.

> It provides environment to deploy and undeploy the web applications.

> It will add middleware services only to deployed web applications.

> It provies environment to execute all client side web resource program at 
  browser window.

> Web server will give output to browser window as dynamic response.

> It will automate whole process of web application and web resource program 
  execution.

To execute java program we required JRE/JVM.

To execute servlet program we required servlet container.

To execute JSP program we required JSP container.

Web Container
===============
It is a software application or a program which is used manage whole life cycle of web resource program exection i.e birth to death.

Servlet container manage whole life cycle of servelt program.

Jsp container manage whole life cycle of jsp program.

Some part of industry considers servlet container and jsp container are 
web containers.

Every web server is designed to support servlet container and jsp container.


Tomcat 
=======
Version			:	7.x 

Vendor			:	Apache Foundation 

website			:	https://tomcat.apache.org/

Default Port		:	8080

Open source		:	Open source 

Servlet container	:	Catalina 

Jsp container		:	Jasper

Tomcat is a not a container. It is a server containing servlet container and jsp container.

Before 6.x version Tomcat is known as web server.From 6.x version onwards Tomcat is also known as application server.

Tomcat installation will ask following things.

1) HTTP connector port 

2) Admintrator username and password 

3) JRE location (parallel to jdk)

4) Tomcat install location 

Tomcat installation
==================
Click on Tomcat software --> yes ---> Next --> I Agree --> 
type of install : full --> Next --> 

Http Connector port : 2525

adminstrator username : admin 
adminstrator password : admin  ---> Next ---> Next --> Install.


How to set tomcat server in manual mode
=======================================

services(view local services) ---> select Apache Tomcat --> click to stop link --> double click to Apache Tomcat --> startup type : manuall --> apply -->ok
